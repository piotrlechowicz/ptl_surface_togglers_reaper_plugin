# Surface Togglers Reaper plugin

Plugin that creates dummy toggle actions which can be mapped to surface control buttons.

Developed for REAPER v6.32-beta version.

### Specify toggle names

Toggles can be specified in `PTL/SurfTog/config.txt` file, where each toggle name should be put in separate lines. 

There is speciall toggle `ClearAll` that unlit all toggles.

### Credits
